# Prototype implementation of feature based matching for libfprint based on AKAZE openCV.

## The goal
- allow for single touch verify/identify for small sensors, which do not provide many minutiae (1)
- match the single image from the sensor with a (enrolled) stiched full-sized finger image (2)
- allow for generating this full-size image within libfprint (3)

## The current status
- goal (1) achieved with AKAZE feature based matching
  - first match the single read with the full-sized image
  - take the median coordinates of the matches and cut out a portion of the full image to repeat the matching
    - optimally, the cutout directly corresponds to the single read (of course we add some margin ...)
    - reduces false positives & negatives as we cannot match parts of the images that do not belong together
  - calculate the homography between the matched keypoints and filter for false matches
    - if we have enough matches fulfilling the homography, we have a MATCH!
- goal (2) achieved by providing a manually generated full-sized image and saving the (binarized, i.e. not gray-scale) image data in addition to the minutia data during enroll
  - upon verify/identify, the data is loaded for the matching
  - the full-sized image was generated manually using PTgui to stitch several small images
- goal (3) to be done ... (not sure when ...)

If you want to use this code on your system, you need to install openCV first (and possibly do other stuff, which I do not remember anymore).
Feel free to drop me a message, I'll try to help out.
