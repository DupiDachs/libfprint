# Prototype implementation of feature based matching for libfprint based on AKAZE openCV.

## The goal
- allow for single touch verify/identify for small sensors, which do not provide many minutiae (1)
- match the single image from the sensor with a (enrolled) stiched full-sized finger image (2)
- allow for generating this full-size image within libfprint (3)

## The current status
- goal (1) achieved with AKAZE features based matching
- goal (2) achieved by providing a manually generated full-sized image and saving the (binarized, i.e. not gray-scale) image data in addition to the minutia data during enroll
  - upon verify/identify, the data is loaded for the matching
  - the full-sized image was generated manually using PTgui to stitch several small images
- goal (3) to be done ... (not sure when ...)
